### Backend

This branch holds the latest code for the backend branch. The backend is architected to be a central server, serving a web service outlined in our public API.

The backend primarily uses Java, using Spring[https://spring.io] as our framework of choice.

We are using SpringBoot[https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot] to bootstrap our application, with the following spring extensions: SpringMVC [] and Spring Data JPA, interacting with a MySQL server on the backend.

Other technologies used:

- Lombok [https://projectlombok.org]
